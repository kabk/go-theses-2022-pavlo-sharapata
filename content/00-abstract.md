Every day we pass by fossils from as early as 541 million years ago (Mya), which are ingrained in our urban architecture as well as in public art. But how did these biological remains of prehistoric life get trapped in our man-made landscapes? Why did they lose their historical significance and at one point become a part of a construction material? More importantly, how does their meaning change within the forms they are adapted to?<br>
<br>

My thesis, titled *Neohabitat* explores petrified remains that can be found outside of museum doors and settings. Additionally, it investigates the makeup of monuments and their specific microscopic setup, for example sediments that encapsulate and contain traces of events. Each fossil, salt mineral or sand molecule, could be a recording of the past. Equal to the monument itself they form a stone memory, a memory of a different era or period in history.<br>
<br>

Parallel to fossils, monuments are manifestations of certain events in history, forming one way how cultures and humankind choose to collectively remember them. The fossil embedded in [strata](#figure "Strata Formation (Jujuy Province, Argentina)") is as symbolic to the monument that is embedded in our public landscape; the fossil itself is a geological monument. By the use of paleontological and architectural sources, I explore the meaning of the monument through its materiality as well as the phenomenon of fossil circulation in geology, modernist architecture and public art.
