Using diverse sources such as paleontological, archeological, architectural and historical archives&hairsp;—&hairsp;I examine the connection between biological inclusions and their sociopolitical meanings, materials in architecture, sculpture and public art. Starting from my home country&hairsp;—&hairsp;Ukraine, I research the ecological and cultural significance of petrified remains which play a major role in the composition of our urban landscapes.
