### Istoriya

</div>

As a child I was very much interested in history. I wasn't good at it, nevertheless it was quite a fascination of mine. Looking back, I see that this particular interest was imperceptibly and very carefully forced on me by my father, who discovered the study and the documentation of the past in his young years and found it extremely fascinating. Wishing to introdice me to history as soon as possible without '&hairsp;loosing&hairsp;' any time&hairsp;—&hairsp;he showed me Egyptians, Greeks and Romans even before I even understood what the Ukrainian word '&hairsp;iсторія&hairsp;' (isto-riya; English: *history*) stands for.

### Equal Relevance

What I discovered later was my genuine excitement to discover things alike the appearance of [Banded Ironstone formations](#figure "Banded Ironstone Formation (Ricardo, California, United States)") over the [Paleoproterozoic Era](#footnote "The Paleoproterozoic Era is a time period spanning from 2500 to 1600 million years ago, is the first of the three sub-divisions (Eras) of the Proterozoic Eon. The Paleoproterozoic is also the longest Era of the Earth's geological history. It was during this Era that the continents first stabilized.|<i>Paleontological Evidence on the Earth's Rotational History Since Early Precambrian</i> (1972)|© Giorgio Pannella"), or the arrival of first [Non-avian mammals](#footnote "A Non-avian mammal is a mammal that is not of or relating to birds.|Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2022)|© Merriam-Webster") during the [Mesozoic Era](#footnote "The Mesozoic Era is the second-to-last Era of Earth's geological history, lasting from about 252 to 66 million years ago and comprising the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. It is characterized by the dominance of archosaurian reptiles, like the dinosaurs, conifers and ferns, a hot greenhouse climate, and the tectonic break-up of Pangaea supercontinent.|USGS (2022)|© USGS"), rather than going through countless invasions in Europe or controversial colonization processes all over the world. In other words&hairsp;—&hairsp;perhaps it was my school's fault, that introduced me to the more recent events of human history in a considerably less enthusiastic manner by prioritizing early historical events, or I simply considered the earlier events more relevant and simply had a greater passion for geological and astronomical speculation about secrets of [*deep time*](#footnote "<i>Deep time</i> is a term introduced and applied by John McPhee. The modern concept entails huge changes over the age of the Earth which has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, approximately 4.55 billion years.|<i>Basin and Range</i> (1981)|© John McPhee")&hairsp;—&hairsp;the gigantic chunk of non-human history that shaped the world as we perceive it today. The concept of *deep time* dates back to 18th-century geologist [James Hutton](#figure "James Hutton (1726 – 1797)"), who proposed that Earth was a lot older than 6000 years, as most people thought at the time.<br>

Said in 1854 [Leopold von Ranke](#figure "Leopold von Ranke (1795 – 1886)")&hairsp;—&hairsp;a German historian and one of the founders of modern source-based history. What Von Ranke meant is that every period of history is unique and must be understood in its own separate context. Further, he argues that planet's history is in its absolute totality and that all historical periods are equally relevant. Therefore, for example the [Paleozoic Era](#footnote "The Paleozoic Era is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon. It is the longest of the Phanerozoic Eras, and is subdivided into six Geologic periods: the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian.|The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica (2022) |© Encyclopaedia Britannica") (538.8&hairsp;–&hairsp;251.9 Mya) is not more or less relevant than the [Classical Era](#footnote "The Classical Era was mainly centered around the civilizations on the Mediterranean Sea and their contributions to world culture. Modern day civilizations in the west such as countries in Europe, the USA, Canada, and countries in South America are founded on many tenets derived from Ancient Greece and Rome.|The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica (2022) |© Encyclopaedia Britannica") (600 B.C.&hairsp;–&hairsp;A.D. 476). Similarly, we may better understand deep time by looking closer to our present surroundings.

### The Museum

</div>

In 2012, I moved to the capital of Ukraine&hairsp;—&hairsp;Kyiv. At the time, I was unfamiliar with the city and thus began exploring it on my own. Alike a flaneur I strolled through the city, which one day led me to the National Science and Natural History Museum of Ukraine. It turned out to be one of the biggest scientific research museums in the world, and was established in 1966. The museum is a comprehensive unified complex which consists of four sections: [Geological](#footnote "Geological means relating to Geology. Geology is a branch of Earth science concerned with both the liquid and solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time.|Online Etymology Dictionary (2022)|© Douglas Harper"), [Zoological](#footnote "Zoological means relating to Zoology. Zoology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct.|Online Etymology Dictionary (2022)|© Douglas Harper"), [Botanical](#footnote "Botanical means relating to Botany. Botany is the science of plant life and a branch of biology.

Paleontology is the scientific study of life that existed prior to the start of the Holocene epoch (11700 years before present). It includes the study of fossils, their interactions with each other and environments.|Online Etymology Dictionary (2022)|© Douglas Harper").<br>
<br>

Days later, if by the [*Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon*](#footnote "The <i>Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon</i>, known as '&hairsp;Frequency Illusion&hairsp;', is a cognitive bias in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has a high frequency of occurrence. It occurs when increased awareness of something creates the illusion that it is appearing more often. The name was coined in 1994 by a commenter on the St. Paul Pioneer Press Terry Mullen, who came up with it after hearing the name of the Baader–Meinhof Group terrorist group twice in 24 hours.|<i>Just Between Dr. Language and I</i> (2005)|© Arnold Zwicky") or simply by a newly awakened interest, I caught sight of one particular wall in  one of the stations of city’s metro, and the deepest station in a world&hairsp;—&hairsp;[Arsenalna](#figure "Arsenalna Metro Station (Kyiv, Ukraine)"). Located 105,5 meters beneath the city, down in its subway hall I noticed two tiny [mollusks](#footnote "Mollusca is the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals after the Arthropoda, the members of which are known as mollusks or molluscs. Around 85000 extant species of mollusks are recognized.|<i>Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World</i> (2009)|© Arthur D. Chapman") embedded in the stone wall. Both appeared to be uncannily similar to those that I had seen in the museum earlier. I began to look around, reading the city like a detective while excavating it in my mind with the lens of an paleontologist. In metro stations, in university campuses, in governmental buildings, in libraries and of course&hairsp;—&hairsp;in monuments: this city began to reveal its little clues of an ancient geological past scattered underneath and above ground. It was that moment right there when I was looking into the deep time of our planet’s history embedded into these compressed forms of mineral fossils.<br>

### Urban Paleontology

</div>

The million year old petrified remains of ancient prehistoric organisms in the museum were and remain fascinating. Of course, they are not the only specimens ingrained in the cityscape. Looking beyond the doors of the museum, there are innumerable examples on public display, and one should add&hairsp;—&hairsp;free of charge. Embedded within walls, pavements, roads and marble stones, the architects of the city have by chance created a museum in public space, providing window to the ancient history of more than a billion years. <br>
<br>

I always thought the most striking evidence of prehistoric life was preserved in dedicated museums where the remains were raised on pedestals, accompanied with signs and descriptions, highlighted by spotlights. But they appeared to be everywhere&hairsp;—&hairsp;embedded in our daily urban  fabric&hairsp;—&hairsp;and I was passing by these half animal&hairsp;/&hairsp;half organic&hairsp;/&hairsp;half solidified stone objects every single day.
