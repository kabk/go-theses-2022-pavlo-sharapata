### Istoriya

</div>

As a child I was very much interested in history. I wasn't good at it, nevertheless it was quite a fascination of mine. Looking back, I see that this particular interest was imperceptibly and very carefully forced on me by my father, who discovered the study and the documentation of the past in his young years and found it extremely fascinating. Wishing to introdice me to history as soon as possible without '&hairsp;loosing&hairsp;' any time&hairsp;—&hairsp;he showed me Egyptians, Greeks and Romans even before I even understood what the Ukrainian word '&hairsp;iсторія&hairsp;' (isto-riya; English: *history*&hairsp;&hairsp;) stands for.

### Equal Relevance

</div>

What I discovered later was my genuine excitement to discover things alike the appearance of Banded Ironstone formations over the Paleoproterozoic Era, or the arrival of first Non-avian mammals during the Mesozoic Era, rather than going through the Mongol invasion of Europe or the controversial colonization processes alike the Portuguese colonization of West Africa and so on. In other words&hairsp;—&hairsp;perhaps it was my school's fault, that introduced me to the more recent events of human history in a considerably less enthusiastic manner by prioritizing early historical events, or I simply considered the earlier events more relevant and simply had a greater passion for geological and astronomical speculation about secrets of *deep time* [^1] &hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;the gigantic chunk of non-human history that shaped the world as we perceive it today. The concept of *deep time*&hairsp; dates back to 18th-century geologist [James Hutton](#figure "James Hutton"), who proposed that Earth was a lot older than 6000 years, as most people thought at the time.<br>

[^1]: *Deep time*&hairsp; is a term introduced and applied by John McPhee to the concept of *geologic time*&hairsp; in his book called *Basin and Range*&hairsp; (1981). The philosophical concept of geological time was developed in the 18th century by Scottish geologist James Hutton. His '&hairsp;system of the habitable Earth&hairsp;' was a deistic mechanism keeping the world eternally suitable for humans. The modern concept entails huge changes over the age of the Earth which has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, approximately 4.55 billion years.

Said [Leopold von Ranke](#figure "Leopold von Ranke") in 1854&hairsp;—&hairsp;a German historian and one of the founders of modern source-based history. What Von Ranke meant is that every period of history is unique and must be understood in its own separate context. Further, he argues that planet's history is in its absolute totality and that all historical periods are equally relevant. Therefore, for example the Paleozoic Era (541&hairsp;–&hairsp;251.902 Mya) is not more or less relevant than the Classical Era (600 B.C.&hairsp;–&hairsp;A.D. 476). Similarly, we may better understand deep time by looking closer to our present surroundings.

### The Museum

</div>

In 2012, I moved to the capital of Ukraine&hairsp;—&hairsp;Kyiv. At the time, I was unfamiliar with the city and thus began exploring it on my own. Alike a flaneur I strolled through the city, which one day led me to the National Science and Natural History Museum of Ukraine. It turned out to be one of the biggest scientific research museums in the world, and it was established in 1966. The museum is a comprehensive unified complex which consists of four sections: Geological, Zoological, Botanical and one more, which particularly caught my interest&hairsp;—&hairsp;Paleontological.<br>
<br>

Days later, if by the *Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon*&hairsp; [^2] or simply by a newly awakened interest, I caught sight of one particular wall in  one of the stations of city’s metro, and the deepest station in a world&hairsp;—&hairsp;[Arsenalna](#figure "Arsenalna Station (Kyiv, Ukraine)"). Located 105 meters beneath the city, down in its subway hall I noticed two tiny mollusks embedded in the stone wall. Both mineralized fossils appeared to be uncannily similar to those that I had seen in the museum earlier. I began to look around, reading the city like a detective while excavating it in my mind with the lens of an paleontologist. In metro stations, in university campuses, in governmental buildings, in libraries and of course&hairsp;—&hairsp;in monuments: this city began to reveal its little clues of an ancient geological past scattered underneath and above ground. It was that moment right there when I was looking into the deep time of our planet’s history embedded into these compressed forms of mineral fossils.<br>

[^2]: The *Baader-Meinhof phenomenon*, also known as '&hairsp;Frequency Illusion&hairsp;' is a cognitive bias in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has a high frequency of occurrence. It occurs when increased awareness of something creates the illusion that it is appearing more often. The name *Baader-Meinhof phenomenon*&hairsp; was derived from a particular instance of frequency illusion in which the Baader-Meinhof Group was mentioned. It was coined in 1994 by a commenter on the St. Paul Pioneer Press' online discussion board, who came up with it after hearing the name of the ultra-left-wing German terrorist group twice in 24 hours.

### Urban Paleontology

</div>

The million year old petrified remains of ancient prehistoric organisms in the museum were and remain fascinating. Of course, they are not the only specimens ingrained in the cityscape. Looking beyond the doors of the museum, there are innumerable examples on public display, and one should add&hairsp;—&hairsp;free of charge. Embedded within walls, pavements, roads and marble stones, the architects of the city have by chance created a museum in public space, providing window to the ancient history of more than a billion years. <br>
<br>

I always thought the most striking evidence of prehistoric life was preserved in dedicated museums where the remains were raised on pedestals, accompanied with signs and descriptions, highlighted by spotlights. But traces of prehistoric life appeared to be everywhere&hairsp;—&hairsp;embedded in our daily urban  fabric&hairsp;—&hairsp;and I was passing by these half animal&hairsp;/&hairsp;half organic&hairsp;/&hairsp;half solidified stone objects every single day.
