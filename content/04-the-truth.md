<div class="subchapter">

### Honesty

</div>

*Truth to Materials*&hairsp; is an architectural approach based on the idea that materials should be exposed and used where they are most appropriate without their textures, colors or other aesthetically specifics being hidden in any way. This idea was first mentioned by the English architect [Augustus Pugin](#figure "Augustus Pugin") in his book *The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture* &hairsp;(1841):<br>
<br>

<div class="quote">“&hairsp;Even the construction itself should vary with the material employed, and the designs should be adapted to the material in which they are executed... Moreover, the architects of the middle ages were the first who turned the natural properties of the various materials to their full account, and made their mechanism a vehicle for their art.&hairsp;”<br>

Maltese architect&hairsp;—&hairsp;Lino Bianco, author of the book *Limestone in Post-War British Architecture: Is it a Plea for a Return to Pugin?* &hairsp;(1998) describes the architectural tendencies inspired by Pugin as:<br>
<br>

<div class="quote">“&hairsp;In Pugin's time it was fashionable to render brick neoclassical buildings into smooth ashlar stonework. Inspired by Pugin's teachings on truth to construction and building materials, architects started to leave brick un-rendered, an inspiration which subsequently lead to the Arts and Crafts Movement and later to Modernism.&hairsp;”<br>

<br>

Although the phrase first originated during the [Industrial Revolution](#figure "Industrial Revolution")&hairsp;—&hairsp;it is most closely associated with post-war Modernist architecture, and it was officially coined 93 years after Pugin’s argument by the acclaimed English sculptor&hairsp;—&hairsp;[Henry Moore](#figure "Henry Moore"):<br>
<br>

<div class="quote">
“&hairsp;Each material has its own individual qualities… Stone, for example, is hard and concentrated and should not be falsified to look like soft flesh… It should keep its hard tense stoniness.&hairsp;”<br>

### Material Inclusion

</div>

The reason why *Truth to Materials* &hairsp;theory is so relevant in the context of a material called [Limestone](#figure "Limestone") is because it is a sedimentary rock which consists mostly of fossils that are frequently visible to the unaided eye. It is a highly valued material by architects because of its bold texture and roughness. It started to receive an appreciation for its natural authenticity, where every block of Limestone was unique and didn't look like any other one. So just as the main principles of Moore's *Truth to Materials*&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;where concrete is left untreated and unsanded, wood's grain is left unpolished and metal left exposed&hairsp;—&hairsp;Limestone is also chosen intentionally for its authentic qualities in a form of fossil inclusions. Along Limestone, inclusions can also be found in materials like Marble, Granite, Gneiss and Quartz. Christopher Barr&hairsp;—&hairsp;a founder of Washington's Urban Museum of Paleontology, notes in the interview with National Building Museum that:<br>
<br>

<div class="quote">
“&hairsp;…architects are aware that the building stones have fossils, and one of the most common types of natural stones used in construction is Limestone, which architects know are generally formed of Biological remains. I am sure that there are exceptions, but architects do not usually seem to be focused on the age or identity of the fossils or the environment in which they were deposited, they are usually more concerned about other characteristics of the stone. The Geological origins of the stone and the nature of the fossils do not seem to play a role in the selection of the stones, as a general matter.&hairsp;”

### Tenet of Modern Architecture

</div>

Right after *Truth to Materials*&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;movements such as *Truth to Structure*, *Truth to Function*&hairsp; and *Truth to the Spirit of Time*&hairsp; have appeared. All of them added even more significance to honesty in architecture, public art and even sculpture and drawing. Architects of 20th century started prioritizing the idea of integrity in architecture which stood for truth to the skeleton of the building, building circulation and materials. And opposition, on the other hand, began to be seen as a deception, an illusion like structural deception, surface deception or even operative deception.<br>
<br>

Modernist, Brutalist and Structuralist architectural styles were invented with the idea to brush off the dust of nostalgia from urban landscapes, with a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and invention of something that was purely functional and new. Coincidentally, some materials that were considered to be the most innovative, revolutionary and '&hairsp;anti-nostalgic&hairsp;', happened to be&hairsp;—&hairsp;organic sedimentary rocks with abilities to encapsulate millions of years of events from the past through their own appearance, and in fact, were the essence &hairsp;of the sentimentality for the past.
