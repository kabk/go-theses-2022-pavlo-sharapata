## The Cycle

<div class="subchapter">

### Other Memory

</div>

As in life, be it organic or inorganic things come or turn in a cycle. Matter&hairsp;—&hairsp;forms, transforms, is born, dies, decays, comes to life in other forms or remains in cycles and fossilises. Knowledge is created, produced, transformed, edited, forgotten and maybe at one point rediscovered and revisited. There seems to be a logic in the cycle and recycling. <br>
<br>

Thus, apart from the official kind of memory created by humans alone and variously embodied in the physical urban space in forms of street name signs, commemorating badges, preserved historical locations etc., there is also certain memory that is expressed in the materiality of the architecture itself. As a matter of fact, materials that are scattered throughout our urban landscapes are not only the carriers of the memory, but also providers of the memory, an enormous archives waiting ready to be discovered. Observing our world of today through the facades made purely out of remainders of ancient past.<br>
<br>

It is fascinating how we, humans, erect our own memory by the use of other memory as a material. We are building institutions and memorial complexes out of sediments from the past, out of nature's unconscious memory which is full of evolution, life processes, extinction events, and elements that formed our planet. It is a fossil cycle within Geology and artificiality. We can only construct something on our planet out of something that is found on our planet, and thus natural materials are in constant circulation. One will call them '&hairsp;natural resources&hairsp;', although in reality there is not such thing on Earth as natural resource, because our nature does not invest anything in resourcefulness, conclusively, resources are only created by humans. Our natural environment only provides us with raw matter, and this raw matter becomes a resource only if, only insofar as and only when, our ingenuity finds a way to exploit it in a form that fits our human needs.<br>

### Stone Age Statuette

</div>

Nature's memory has been constantly overridden and converted into a human memory since around 30,000 years ago when stone carving was first invented. As a result of it were earliest *Venus Figurine* &hairsp;sculptures&hairsp;—&hairsp;late Stone Age statuettes portraying a woman, usually carved in the round. Over 200 of them were found worldwide. *Venus of Willendorf* &hairsp;and *Venus of Hohle Fels* &hairsp;just to name a few, both were cut out of natural resources, or more appropriate&hairsp;—&hairsp;suitable raw materials, such as oolitic Limestone and mammoth ivory, etc. Most of *Venus Figurine* &hairsp;sculptures were rather small and varying between 3 and 40 cm in height because it is assumed that these figures were made to be mobile, as they have been found at sites ranging from Europe to the farthest regions of Siberia.<br>

### Colossal Sculpture

</div>

As humans mastered carving techniques and became more familiar with the materials around them, they began exploring the potential of on site sculpting. This usually referred to as&hairsp;—&hairsp;*in situ* &hairsp;technique, the name comes from latin '&hairsp;on site&hairsp;' or '&hairsp;in position&hairsp;'. In sculpture, it refers to the artworks that were carved into mountains and rocks, and that the work itself takes into account the site in which it is installed.<br>
<br>

*Naqsh-e Rostam*&hairsp; or '&hairsp;Picture of Rostam&hairsp;' in Persian is an ancient archeological site located northwest of Persepolis, in the Fars Province in Iran&hairsp;—&hairsp;and is one of the most unusual examples of colossal *in situ*&hairsp; sculpture. *Naqsh-e Rostam*, also know as Persian crosses is a cemetery of the Achaemenid dynasty (550&hairsp;–&hairsp;330 B.C.), with four large cross-shaped geometrical tombs and inscriptions cut deep into the cliff. These are the Tomb of Darius II, Artaxerxes I, Darius the Great and Xerxes I. There was supposed to be another&hairsp;—&hairsp;fifth Tomb, of Darius III, but for some reason the construction never has been completed. This *in situ*&hairsp; sculpture is of great importance to the history of Iran, and is considered a one of most important archaeological sites in the country. The carvings were believed to be engraved by Elamites&hairsp;—&hairsp;an ancient civilization centered in the far west of modern-day Iran. <br>

### Regional Construction

</div>

After mastering on site carving techniques, sculptors began working with more thought-out three-dimensional proportions, successfully re-qualifying themselves from sculptors to architects by carving out or building from scratch primitive structures out of local materials like various types of stone, clay or other rock formations. This earliest building approach has been named *Vernacular*&hairsp; architecture. A term coined in 1857 by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English Gothic revival architect, who used it to describe the predominant English architecture during that time in his book *Remarks on Secular & Domestic Architecture, Present & Future*. The term *Vernacular*&hairsp; is actually derived from the Latin '&hairsp;vernaculus&hairsp;', meaning &hairsp;—&hairsp;'&hairsp;domestic, native, indigenous&hairsp;'.<br>
<br>

This architecture style appeared from a combination of, again, suitable and local materials as well as limited knowledge. It described buildings created in pre-industrial societies and used a broad range of materials and construction approaches. Some historians claim that everything that was built before the 17th century should be considered *Vernacular* &hairsp;since there were no professional supervision or guidance during the process of building. <br>

### Non-Pedigreed Architecture

</div>

Timbuktu, a city located in the middle of Mali&hairsp;—&hairsp;a landlocked country in West Africa, has an impressive *Vernacular* &hairsp;architecture scene. Mosques are a common architectural typology and building program present in Mali. One of the examples&hairsp;—&hairsp;*The Djinguereber Mosque*&hairsp; which was built in 1327. This mosque currently serves as a learning center and is protected by UNESCO. Its design is accredited to Abu Ishaq al-Sahili. And although many European texts refer to al-Sahili as an architect and attribute major innovations in West African architecture to him&hairsp;—&hairsp;in reality his contributions to West African architecture were minimal, and he mostly worked as poet and legal scholar. *The Djingareyber Mosque*&hairsp; is made entirely of earth plus organic materials such as fibre, straw and wood which were rendered with mud. It has three inner courts, two minarets and twenty-five rows of pillars aligned in an east-west direction and prayer space. <br>
<br>

Additionally, I would like to mention *The Great Mosque of Djenné*&hairsp; located in the city of Djenné, which is also in Mali. The style of *The Great Mosque of Djenné*&hairsp; apart from *Vernacular*, is also categorized as Sudano-Sahelian architecture and refers to a range of different indigenous architectural styles common in Africa. The exact date of construction of the mosque is unknown, but dates as early as 1200 and as late as 1330 have been suggested by historians. The mosque is made of sun-baked earth bricks (*ferey*&hairsp;&hairsp;), as well as sand and earth based mortar. Bundles of rodier palm sticks embedded in the walls of the Great Mosque were used as decoration.In a book&hairsp;—&hairsp;*Architecture without Architects* &hairsp;(1964) Austrian-American architect Bernard Rudofsky, speaks about the *Vernacular* &hairsp;style:<br>

<div class="quote">

“&hairsp;It is so little known that we don’t even have a name for it. For want of a generic label, we shall call it *vernacular*, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.&hairsp;”

</div><br>

Fast forward a couple of centuries and we clearly see that nothing has changed. We keep doing the same thing just in different forms. We extract preserved remains from under our feet, turn it into suitable resources and build the present out of what essentially is the past.
