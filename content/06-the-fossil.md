## The Fossil

In my last chapter I planned to write about another type of fossils. Monuments. The ones that were built out of remains of ancient past. Bold structures that were raised in Yugoslavia. They were meant to deliver a message during those times, but unconditionally became fossils of current ones. The purpose, the message, the ideology they served is a thing long of the past. They are living fossils, whose existence of course should not to be taken for granted, but at the same time, everything they were meant to live for&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;is gone. They will forever stand as unconscious remainders of the past and beam their message into the void.<br>

Unfortunately, due to war that erupted in my home country and relocation of my family to me&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;I did not manage to finish this chapter and conclusion. I am sorry, and thank you for your understanding.
