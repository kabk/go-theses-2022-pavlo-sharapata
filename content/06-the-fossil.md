## The Fossil

<div class="subchapter">

### Forgotten Meanings

</div>

In my last chapter I planned to write about another type of fossils. [Monuments](#figure "Kosmaj Memorial Complex (Koraćica, Serbia)"). The ones that were built out of actual remains of ancient past mixed together with concrete. Bold, Brutalist structures that were raised in mountains and fields of former Yugoslavia (today: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia). They were meant to deliver a message during those times, but unconditionally became fossils of current ones. The purpose, the message, the ideology they served is a thing long of the past. They are essentially&hairsp;—&hairsp;living fossils, whose existence of course should not to be taken for granted, but at the same time&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;they will forever stand as unconscious remainders of the past and beam their message into the void.<br>

Unfortunately, due to [War](#figure "Ukrainian troops outside of Kyiv") that erupted in my home country and relocation of my family&hairsp;&hairsp;—&hairsp;I did not manage to properly finish this chapter and conclusion. I am sorry, and I thank you kindly for your understanding.
